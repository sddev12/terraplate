# Terraplate

Just a simple Terraform boilerplate with the AWS provider. 

No remote backend configured, so local state will be used as-is. 

For messing around and learning/practicing Terraform, just clone this into a folder you want it in. 

```
git clone https://github.com/sddev12/terraplate ./myLearningProject
```

Then you're away and skip the manotony of setting up from scratch each time.
